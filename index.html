Over the years, The Vamps have released multiple albums, including "Wake Up" (2015), "Night & Day" (2017), and "Cherry Blossom" (2020).

When they came to The Vamps he said it just 'felt right.Connor added: "It also means a throwing together of things, which I guess we like to think we did as a band!"

In another interview, with Hollywood Life, the band revealed they were big fans of The Vampire Diaries and according to James: "Tristan’s a massive fan of Twilight".The Vamps first formed in 2011. James McVey, who already had management, decided he'd like to be part of a band, and subsequently found Brad Simpson through his YouTube channel.
